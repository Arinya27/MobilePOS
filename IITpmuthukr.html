<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>Hi! I am from Tamilnadu, India. I came to the USA by August, 2012 for my graduate studies.I pursued my undergraduate studies in the field of Electronics and Communications Engineering.After graduating in 2010, I was recruited by Cognizant Technology Solutions.  </p>
<h2>My Work Experience </h2>
<p>I have worked with Cognizant Technology Solutions for two years while I was in India.I was a part of "Retail Mobility Group", which provides mobile solutions for Retailers across the world.During my work, I learnt the basics of HTML5, CSS3 and jQueryMobile Framework.
<a href="http://jquerymobile.com"title="A Link">jQueryMobile Framework Site</a>- contains details on jQuery Mobile Framework.
</p>
<p> My work experience is one of the major reasons, I grew interest in this subject. I want to do my specialization in Web Design and Application Development and become a good Web Developer. I have had experience in front end work but not so much in backend processes. Hoping that I will be successfull in both one fine day.</p>
<p> Its nice to share something about me in an assignment, making this more interesting. Thank You !  </p>
